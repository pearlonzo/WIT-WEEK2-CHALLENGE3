### The Challenges
There are two types of challenges, the blog posts which are meant to help you improve your writing skills and the coding challenges which are meant to help you learn javascript and improve your programming logic.
Please note that this is a public repository which means anyone can access the challenges. You are highly encouraged to attempt the challenges yourself as they prepare you for the final project which will be shared later in the program.

Please note that the purpose of the challenges is not to eliminate you from the program but help you learn and prepare you for the projects yet to come.

### The medium blog posts 
As a programmer you will have to write atleast once in a while so as to share knowledge or communicate. As far as communication is concerned it should be effective and professional. The aim of these blog posts is to encourage you to write professionally for both technical and non-technical audiences. You are highly encouraged to research and reflect before writing. While writing watchout for grammatical and spelling errors. You can use [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) to polish up your blog posts.

### The coding challenges:
You will be required to submit solutions to the coding challenges. Solve each challenge in a new repository and share the link of your online repository with your Learning Facilitator at the end of the challenge period for review.

The challenges will introduce a concept or two, after solving the challenge it is advisable that you explore the concept deeper for a better understanding. 

For some of the challenges minimum tests are written for you, ensure that your code makes all tests pass and feel free to add more tests.

Make sure your code is clean and readable. 

### Moving forward
Continue learning and growing. ```Happy coding!!```
